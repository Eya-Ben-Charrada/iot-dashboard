# 🌡️📈 IoT Sensor Dashboard: Temperature & Light Monitoring

This project is a complete **IoT system** that reads data from an **Arduino** (LM35 temperature sensor + CDS light sensor), sends the readings over **MQTT**, stores them in a **local SQLite database**, and visualizes everything in real-time with an interactive **Streamlit dashboard**.

---

## 🔧 Hardware Components

- Arduino UNO (or any compatible board)
- LM35 Temperature Sensor
- CDS Photocell (Light Sensor)
- USB cable for serial communication

├── arduino_code.ino # Arduino code that reads sensors and sends serial data
├── serial_to_mqtt.py # Python script to read serial, send via MQTT, and save to SQLite

## 🔌 How It Works

1. **Arduino** reads temperature and light values every second and sends formatted strings like:

TEMP:25.30;LIGHT:210


2. **`serial_to_mqtt.py`**:
- Reads serial data from Arduino
- Publishes it to an MQTT broker (`test.mosquitto.org`)
- Saves data to a local SQLite database (`sensor_data.db`)

3. **`streamlit_app.py`**:
- Loads data from the SQLite database
- Visualizes the data with charts and metrics
- Provides:
  - Live data updates
  - Date filtering
  - Threshold alerting
  - Min/Max/Avg statistics
  - CSV export

## 🚀 How to Run

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt


### 2. Upload Arduino Code
Open arduino_code.ino in Arduino IDE

Upload it to your Arduino board

Make sure to close the serial monitor before running the Python script

### 3. Run Serial to MQTT & Database Script

```bash
python serial_to_mqtt.py

### 4. Launch the Dashboard

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py


dashboard_features:
  - "📡 Real-time temperature & light readings"
  - "📅 Date range filtering via sidebar"
  - "⚠️ Custom threshold alerts via sidebar"
  - "📉 Separate line charts for temperature and light"
  - "📈 Min, max, and average display"
  - "📥 Download historical data as CSV"
  - "🔄 Auto-refresh every X seconds"

use_cases:
  - "Indoor environmental monitoring"
  - "Classroom IoT projects"
  - "Smart farming or greenhouses"
  - "Home automation prototypes"

notes:
  - "The MQTT broker used (test.mosquitto.org) is public — for production use, consider setting up a private or secured broker (e.g., HiveMQ, Mosquitto with TLS)."
  - "Update the COM port in serial_to_mqtt.py if needed (e.g., 'COM3' to 'COM4', etc.)."
